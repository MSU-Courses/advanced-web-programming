It is celebrated in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other Eastern European countries. The festival lasts for a week and is often called \"Pancake Week\" because eating pancakes (blini) is a key tradition. Blini symbolize the sun, as they are round and golden, representing warmth and renewal. Each day of Maslenitsa has its own customs, including sledding, feasting, and games. The week ends with \"Forgiveness Sunday,\" when people ask each other for forgiveness before the start of Lent. The main highlight is the burning of the Maslenitsa effigy, a straw figure that symbolizes winter. This ritual represents letting go of the cold season and welcoming the warmth of spring. Although originally a pagan festival, Maslenitsa later became associated with Orthodox Christian traditions.","categories":["celebration","lifestyle"],"date":"2025-02-25"}]
