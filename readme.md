# Advanced Web Development

A repository containing all the necessary resources for the **Advanced Web Development** course: theoretical materials, laboratory work, topics for assessments, and exams.

This course is designed for second-year students of the `Informatics & Applied Informatics` program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Moldova State University.

## Introduction

Welcome! If you're here, there are probably a couple of reasons why:  

1. You want to dive into web development.  
2. You’re preparing for an exam or assessment.  

I assume the second option is more likely, but I still hold out hope for the first. If it is indeed the first, then I have just one question: ["Who are you, warrior?"](https://i.imgur.com/GRHnz3A.png).  

Alright, enough jokes. Let’s figure out why this guide exists and how it can be useful to you.  

### Who is this course for?

This material is designed for students just beginning their journey into web development. Inside, you’ll find simple examples—perhaps even overly simplistic at times. Occasionally, you may come across basic analogies or a touch of "embellishment." This is all intentional, to make complex concepts easier to grasp and help you take your first steps in this exciting field.  

Experienced developers likely won’t find much new here. However, who knows? You might stumble upon something interesting or refresh your knowledge.  

### What makes this course different?

I won’t claim that this course is the best out there. It’s unique. It was created with one purpose in mind: to make complex topics understandable and accessible for beginners.
